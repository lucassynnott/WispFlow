# WispFlow - Voice to Text Mac App

## Overview

WispFlow is a native macOS application that provides system-wide voice-to-text dictation with AI-powered transcription and auto-editing. It works in any application, turning natural speech into polished, formatted text.

## Problem Statement

Typing is slow (~45 WPM) compared to speaking (~150+ WPM). Existing voice dictation tools produce raw, unedited transcriptions full of filler words, poor punctuation, and formatting issues. Users need a tool that captures speech and intelligently transforms it into clean, professional text.

## Core Features

### 1. System-Wide Voice Dictation
- **Global hotkey activation** - Press a key combo (e.g., Cmd+Shift+Space) to start/stop recording from any app
- **Menu bar app** - Minimal UI, lives in the system tray
- **Works in any text field** - Slack, email, VS Code, browsers, Notes, etc.
- **Real-time audio capture** - Uses macOS microphone APIs

### 2. AI-Powered Transcription (Local)
- **Speech-to-text engine** - Local Whisper model (whisper.cpp or MLX Whisper)
- **Fully offline** - No cloud API calls, all processing on-device
- **High accuracy** - Support for natural speech patterns, pauses, corrections
- **Low latency** - Transcribe and insert text quickly after speaking
- **Model options** - Support tiny/base/small/medium models for speed vs accuracy tradeoff

### 3. Auto-Editing & Cleanup
- **Remove filler words** - "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
- **Fix grammar and punctuation** - Proper capitalization, periods, commas
- **Format naturally** - Convert rambling speech into clear sentences
- **Preserve intent** - Keep the user's meaning while cleaning up delivery

### 4. Personal Dictionary
- **Custom vocabulary** - Names, technical terms, company-specific words
- **Auto-learn** - Detect and remember frequently used unique words
- **Corrections** - Allow user to correct misheard words and learn from them

### 5. Snippet Library
- **Voice shortcuts** - Say "my calendar" and insert a full booking link
- **Templates** - Common responses, signatures, boilerplate text
- **Quick triggers** - Short phrases that expand to longer content

### 6. App-Aware Tone Adjustment
- **Context detection** - Know which app is active (Slack vs Email vs Code)
- **Tone matching** - Casual for chat, professional for email, technical for code comments
- **Configurable per-app** - User can customize tone rules

### 7. Multi-Language Support
- **Language detection** - Auto-detect spoken language
- **Multiple languages** - Support major languages (English, Spanish, French, German, etc.)
- **Seamless switching** - Handle mid-sentence language changes

### Platform
- macOS 13.0+ (Ventura or later)
- Native Swift/SwiftUI application
- Apple Silicon and Intel support

### Architecture
- **Menu bar app** - NSStatusItem for system tray presence
- **Global hotkey** - CGEvent tap or NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents
- **Audio capture** - AVAudioEngine for microphone input
- **Text insertion** - Accessibility APIs or CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent
- **AI integration** - Local Whisper (whisper.cpp/MLX) for transcription, local LLM (llama.cpp/MLX) for text cleanup

### Permissions Required
- Microphone access
- Accessibility permissions (for text insertion)
- Optional: Screen recording (for app context detection)

### Data & Privacy
- **100% Local** - All audio and text processing happens on-device
