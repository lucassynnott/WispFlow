## Design Skill Reference

This PRD incorporates the **frontend-design** skill for Phase 5. Key principles:

1. **Bold Aesthetic Direction**: Commit to a distinct visual identity - refined/professional, moody/dark, or crisp/light
2. **No Generic AI Aesthetics**: Avoid Inter, Roboto, purple gradients, cookie-cutter layouts
3. **Typography First**: Display fonts with personality, refined body text, clear hierarchy
4. **Intentional Color**: Lead with dominant color, punctuate with sharp accents
5. **Motion & Delight**: Spring animations, staggered reveals, micro-interactions
6. **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, z-depth, generous whitespace OR intentional density

Every UI element should feel **distinctive, memorable, and production-grade**.
