# WispFlow v0.5 - Beautiful Modern Light Mode UI

## Overview

Transform WispFlow from a basic utility into a visually stunning, polished macOS application with a distinctive light mode aesthetic. The UI should feel premium, memorable, and delightful to use.

## Design Vision

### Aesthetic Direction: Refined Editorial Minimalism
- **Tone**: Clean, sophisticated, warm - like a beautifully designed magazine or premium productivity app
- **Inspiration**: Linear, Raycast, Things 3, Craft - apps known for exceptional UI polish
- **Differentiation**: Warm cream/ivory tones instead of harsh white, subtle textures, elegant typography, micro-interactions that delight

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Warm ivory/cream (#FEFCF8) - not harsh white
- **Surface**: Soft white (#FFFFFF) with subtle shadows
- **Primary Accent**: Warm coral/terracotta (#E07A5F) - distinctive, not generic blue
- **Secondary**: Muted sage green (#81B29A) for success states
- **Text Primary**: Warm charcoal (#2D3436) - not pure black
- **Text Secondary**: Warm gray (#636E72)
- **Borders**: Very subtle warm gray (#E8E4DF)

### Typography
- **Display/Headers**: SF Pro Rounded or similar soft geometric sans
- **Body**: SF Pro Text for readability
- **Monospace**: SF Mono for any code/technical elements
- **Style**: Generous letter-spacing for headers, comfortable line-height

### Visual Details
- **Shadows**: Soft, warm-toned shadows (not harsh gray)
- **Corners**: Generous border-radius (12-16px) for cards and buttons
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, breathing room
- **Textures**: Subtle noise/grain overlay for depth
- **Icons**: SF Symbols with custom tinting
