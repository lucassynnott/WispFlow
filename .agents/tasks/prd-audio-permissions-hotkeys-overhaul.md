# PRD: WispFlow Audio, Permissions & Hotkeys Overhaul

## Introduction

This PRD defines a comprehensive overhaul of WispFlow's core systems based on proven patterns from Voquill (an open-source voice-to-text app). The goal is to fix critical reliability issues with audio capture, hotkey detection, and permission handling while adding a polished onboarding experience.

**Key Problems Being Solved:**
- Audio input not detecting from microphones
- Hotkeys not being recognized reliably
- Settings UI elements not clickable/visible
- No guided setup for permissions on first launch
- Clipboard content lost during text insertion

**Reference Implementation:** [Voquill](https://github.com/josiahsrc/voquill) - patterns ported to Swift equivalents.

---

## Goals

- Fix audio capture reliability across all macOS input devices
- Implement smart device selection that avoids low-quality inputs (Bluetooth, AirPods)
- Create robust global hotkey detection that works consistently
- Add guided onboarding wizard for permissions on first launch
- Preserve clipboard content during text insertion
- Improve Settings UI accessibility and interactivity
- Provide real-time audio level preview that actually works

## User Stories

### Phase 1: Audio System Overhaul

### [x] US-501: Smart Audio Device Selection
**Description:** As a user, I want WispFlow to automatically select the best available microphone so I don't have to manually configure audio settings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] System ranks available input devices by quality score
- [x] Bluetooth devices (AirPods, Beats, etc.) deprioritized automatically
- [x] Devices with sample rate ≤16kHz deprioritized
- [x] Built-in microphone preferred over Bluetooth when both available
- [x] USB/external microphones given highest priority
- [x] Example: MacBook with AirPods connected → selects "MacBook Pro Microphone" not "AirPods Pro"
- [x] Negative case: Only Bluetooth mic available → uses it with warning toast
- [x] Device selection logged to console for debugging
- [x] Typecheck passes (`swift build` succeeds)

### [x] US-502: Audio Device Caching
**Description:** As a user, I want recording to start quickly without device enumeration delay on subsequent recordings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Last successfully used device cached in memory
- [x] Cache used for fast-path device selection on next recording
- [x] Cache invalidated when user manually changes device in Settings
- [x] Cache invalidated when cached device disconnected

## Functional Requirements

### Audio System
- **FR-1:** AudioManager must reset engine before each recording session
- **FR-2:** AudioManager must prepare engine before setting input device
- **FR-3:** AudioManager must validate input format (sample rate > 0, channels > 0)
- **FR-4:** AudioManager must connect input to muted mixer sink for tap to receive data
- **FR-5:** AudioManager must cache last successful device for fast subsequent recordings
- **FR-6:** AudioManager must score devices: USB mics > built-in > Bluetooth
- **FR-7:** AudioManager must emit currentAudioLevel at 20Hz during capture

### Permissions
- **FR-8:** App must check microphone permission before recording
- **FR-9:** App must check accessibility permission before hotkey registration
- **FR-10:** App must open specific System Settings pane via URL scheme
- **FR-11:** App must re-check permissions when becoming active

### Hotkeys
- **FR-12:** HotkeyManager must use CGEvent tap for global detection
- **FR-13:** HotkeyManager must require accessibility permission
- **FR-14:** HotkeyManager must support Cmd+Shift+Space as default
- **FR-15:** HotkeyManager must persist custom hotkey to UserDefaults

### Text Insertion
- **FR-16:** TextInserter must save clipboard before insertion
- **FR-17:** TextInserter must restore clipboard after 800ms delay
- **FR-18:** TextInserter must use CGEvent for Cmd+V simulation
- **FR-19:** TextInserter must provide fallback notification on failure

### Onboarding
- **FR-20:** App must show onboarding wizard on first launch
- **FR-21:** Onboarding must guide through microphone permission

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **No cross-platform support** - This PRD is macOS only
- **No Rust/Swift bridge** - Pure Swift implementation
- **No screen context extraction** - Advanced accessibility features deferred
- **No real-time transcription streaming** - Batch transcription only
- **No cloud-based audio processing** - Local Whisper only
- **No multi-language onboarding** - English only for now
- **No automatic updates** - Manual updates via GitHub releases

---

## Technical Considerations

### Audio Architecture
- Use `AVAudioEngine` with proper initialization sequence
- Install tap on input node with buffer size 4096
- Convert to 16kHz mono for Whisper
- Use `AVAudioMixerNode` as sink to ensure tap receives data

### Permission APIs
- `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus(for: .audio)` for microphone
- `AXIsProcessTrusted()` for accessibility
- `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions()` with prompt for first request
- `NSWorkspace.shared.open(URL)` for System Settings

### Hotkey Implementation
- `CGEvent.tapCreate()` for global event monitoring
- `CGEventTapLocation.cgSessionEventTap` for user session events
- `CGEventMask` for key down events
- Run loop source for event processing

### SwiftUI Considerations
- Avoid `@State` directly in `ButtonStyle` - use wrapper View
- Use `contentShape(Rectangle())` for hit testing
- Avoid `ZStack` overlays that block interaction
- Test all UI interactions after each change

---

## Success Metrics

- **Audio capture success rate:** 95%+ of recordings capture actual audio
- **Hotkey reliability:** 99%+ of hotkey presses detected
- **Permission setup completion:** 80%+ of new users complete onboarding
- **Settings usability:** All buttons/toggles clickable on first try
- **Time to first transcription:** < 2 minutes for new users with onboarding

---

## Open Questions

1. Should we add a "Test Recording" feature in Settings (record → playback)?
2. Should onboarding include Whisper model download or defer to first use?
3. Should we add keyboard shortcut hints in the UI (tooltips)?
4. Should we persist audio device preference across app restarts?
5. Should we add a system tray notification when hotkey is pressed?

---

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **US-523, US-524, US-525** - Fix Settings UI first (unblocks testing)
2. **US-503, US-504** - Fix audio engine initialization and preview
3. **US-501, US-502** - Smart device selection and caching
4. **US-506, US-507, US-508** - Permission system
5. **US-510, US-511** - Hotkey overhaul
6. **US-513, US-514** - Clipboard preservation
7. **US-516 through US-522** - Onboarding wizard (last, uses all other systems)

## Routing Policy
- Commit URLs are invalid.
- Unknown GitHub subpaths canonicalize to repo root.
