US-103 is complete. There are still 3 unchecked stories remaining (US-104, US-105, US-106), so the PRD is not fully complete yet.

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-103: Improve Model Loading** with the following changes:

1. **StatusBarController.swift**: Added model status observation using Combine, dynamic menu bar icons reflecting model state (waveform.slash/arrow.down.circle/arrow.clockwise.circle/waveform/exclamationmark.triangle), tooltips with status details, and a model status menu item with emoji indicators (🟢🔄🔵⚪🔴).

2. **AppDelegate.swift**: Added recording blocking when model is not ready with `showModelNotReadyAlert()` that provides context-aware error messages and an "Open Settings" button.

3. **WhisperManager.swift**: Enhanced `loadModel()` to distinguish between downloading new models vs loading cached models, with proper status updates for download progress.
