## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-521: Hotkey Introduction Step** for the WispFlow onboarding wizard.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `HotkeyIntroductionView` with prominently displayed current hotkey (⌘⇧Space) using `HotkeyKeyBadge` components
- Added "Try it now!" prompt with pulsing indicator to encourage users to test the hotkey
- Implemented visual feedback when hotkey is pressed: icon changes to checkmark, card scales up, "Perfect!" success message appears
- Added "Change Hotkey" option that expands `OnboardingHotkeyRecorder` for customization
- Included default hotkey recommendation note for most users
- Updated the onboarding flow to pass `hotkeyManager` through the component hierarchy

**Commits:**
- `b8b1e76` feat(US-521): implement hotkey introduction step for onboarding wizard
- `3da8cc8` docs: update progress log for US-521 implementation

**Verification:** `swift build` passed with only pre-existing Swift 6 informational warnings.

There are still 4 stories remaining in the PRD (US-522, US-523, US-524, US-525), so the completion signal is not output.
