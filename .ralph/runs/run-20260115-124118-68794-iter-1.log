US-706 is now complete. There are still 3 remaining open stories in the PRD (US-707, US-708, US-709), so I cannot output the completion signal.

**Summary of changes made for US-706:**

Successfully migrated the Text Insertion Settings Section to the integrated settings view in MainWindow.swift:

1. **Insertion Method Section** - Shows Paste (⌘V) method with card-based UI, "Active" badge, and feature list
2. **Clipboard Preservation Toggle** - Toggle with status indicator showing if clipboard will be restored
3. **Timing Options Section** - Custom slider (0.2s-2.0s) for clipboard restore delay, only shown when preservation is enabled
4. **Accessibility Permission Section** - Permission status card with grant button and step-by-step instructions
5. **How It Works Section** - Numbered steps explaining the text insertion flow

Created 5 new supporting components following the established design system patterns:
- `TextInsertionMethodCard`
- `TextInsertionToggleRow`
- `TextInsertionDelaySlider`
- `TextInsertionInstructionRow`
- `TextInsertionFeatureRow`

All acceptance criteria verified:
- ✅ Insertion method selection works
- ✅ Clipboard preservation toggle functions
