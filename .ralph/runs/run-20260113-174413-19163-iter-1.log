All tasks are complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-106: Local LLM Text Cleanup** for WispFlow. The implementation includes:

### Key Changes:
1. **Added llama.swift dependency** - Provides access to llama.cpp for local LLM inference via Swift Package Manager
2. **Created LLMManager.swift** - Full LLM lifecycle management including:
   - 3 model sizes: Qwen 2.5 1.5B, Phi-3 Mini, Gemma 2B (quantized GGUF formats)
   - Model download from Hugging Face with progress tracking
   - Model loading using llama.cpp APIs
   - Text generation with tokenization, batch processing, and greedy sampling
3. **Added AI-Powered cleanup mode** - New cleanup mode in TextCleanupManager that uses LLM when available
4. **Implemented automatic fallback** - If LLM unavailable or fails, falls back to thorough rule-based cleanup
5. **Updated Settings UI** - LLM model selection, status display, download/load/delete buttons in the Text Cleanup tab

### Verification:
- `swift build` passes successfully (with expected Sendable warnings for OpaquePointer)

### Commits:
- `bc5e741` - feat(US-106): implement local LLM text cleanup with llama.cpp
- `10689a1` - docs: update progress log for US-106

All 6 stories in the PRD v0.2 are now complete (US-101 through US-106).
