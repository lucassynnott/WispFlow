There are still 4 uncompleted stories (US-633, US-634, US-635, US-636) in the PRD. Since I completed US-632 but there are remaining stories, I should NOT output the completion signal.

Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I successfully implemented **US-632: Main Window with Sidebar Navigation** for WispFlow. Here's what was done:

**Files Created/Modified:**
1. **Sources/WispFlow/MainWindow.swift** (new) - Contains:
   - `NavigationItem` enum with 5 navigation items (Home, History, Snippets, Dictionary, Settings)
   - `MainWindowView` - SwiftUI view with sidebar navigation and content area
   - `NavigationItemRow` - Individual navigation item component with hover/active states
   - `MainWindowController` - AppKit window controller handling window lifecycle and state persistence
   - Placeholder content views for each navigation section

2. **Sources/WispFlow/AppDelegate.swift** (modified) - Added:
   - `mainWindowController` property
   - `openMainWindow()` method
   - Callback connection for StatusBarController

3. **Sources/WispFlow/StatusBarController.swift** (modified) - Added:
   - `onOpenMainWindow` callback
   - "Open WispFlow" menu item (Cmd+O)
   - `openMainWindow()` action method

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Fixed left sidebar (220px expanded, 70px collapsed) with app branding
- 5 navigation items with distinctive SF Symbol icons  
- Active state highlighting with left accent bar and background color
- Smooth hover state transitions
- Window state persistence via UserDefaults and NSWindow.setFrameAutosaveName
- Minimum window size: 800x600px
- Auto-collapse sidebar when window width < 700px
- Manual collapse/expand toggle button

**Verification:**
- `swift build` → PASS
