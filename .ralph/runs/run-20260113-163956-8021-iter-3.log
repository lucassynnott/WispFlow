All 6 acceptance criteria in the PRD are covered by the completed stories. Since all stories in the MVP scope (US-001 through US-007) are now complete, the PRD is fully implemented.

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-007: Settings Persistence** for WispFlow. Here's what was implemented:

**Key Changes:**
1. **HotkeyManager.swift** - Added UserDefaults persistence for hotkey configuration (keyCode and modifiers), with load/save methods and reset-to-default capability

2. **SettingsWindow.swift** - Added complete General Settings tab with:
   - HotkeyRecorderView for recording custom keyboard shortcuts
   - Launch at Login toggle using SMAppService
   - About section with version info
   - Moved General tab to first position

3. **AppDelegate.swift** - Updated to pass hotkeyManager to SettingsWindowController

All settings now persist between sessions:
- Hotkey configuration (via HotkeyManager)
- Model selection (via WhisperManager)
- Text cleanup mode/enabled (via TextCleanupManager)
- Clipboard preservation settings (via TextInserter)
- Audio device selection (via AudioManager)
- Launch at login (via SMAppService - system-managed)

**Commits:**
- `47f3c13` feat(US-007): implement settings persistence
- `9162397` docs: update progress log for US-007

All MVP stories (US-001 through US-007) are now complete. 🎉
