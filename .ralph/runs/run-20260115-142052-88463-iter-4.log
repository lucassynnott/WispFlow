## Summary

I've completed the work for **US-804: Daily Insights Sidebar**. The implementation was already done in a previous iteration and includes:

1. **dailyInsightsSidebar** computed property in `HomeContentView` showing:
   - Words Spoken with large number and percentage change indicator
   - Time Saved with comparison label ("vs typing at 40 WPM")
   - Today's Pace (average WPM when activity exists)

2. **DailyInsightCard** component for individual stat cards with:
   - Icon in colored circle
   - Large numbers using `Font.Voxa.largeTitle` (28pt, bold, rounded)
   - Percentage change indicator
   - Subtitle/comparison text

3. **PercentageChangeIndicator** component showing:
   - Green up arrow for positive change
   - Red down arrow for negative change
   - Formatted percentage badge

4. All stats are connected to `UsageStatsManager` computed properties for actual usage data.

This iteration fixed a build error caused by incomplete US-805 code (broken notification names: `.navigateToTextCleanupSettings` → `.navigateToTextCleanup` and `.showAudioImportPicker` → `.openAudioImport`).

Commits:
- `0210ab4 fix(US-805): fix broken notification names in Quick Tools section`
- `57dafec docs: add progress log entry for US-804 verification`
