**Summary:**

Implemented US-003: Audio Capture with all required functionality:

1. **AudioManager.swift** - Complete audio capture using AVAudioEngine with:
   - Microphone permission request and graceful denial handling (NSAlert directing to System Settings)
   - Audio format conversion to 16kHz mono Float32 for Whisper compatibility
   - Audio buffer accumulation during recording sessions
   - start/stop/cancel recording controls

2. **Audio Input Device Selection** (bonus feature from PRD):
   - Device enumeration using Core Audio APIs
   - Device selection persistence via UserDefaults
   - Device change listener for hot-plug support
   - "Audio Input" submenu in the status bar menu for device selection

3. **Integration** - Connected AudioManager to AppDelegate and StatusBarController for recording lifecycle management

**Verification:** `swift build` passes with no errors.

**Commit:** `33cac3d feat(US-003): implement audio capture with device selection`
