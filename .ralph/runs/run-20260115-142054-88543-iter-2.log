## Summary

US-802: Start Recording Button has been **verified as complete**. 

The implementation was done by a parallel agent in commit `a5e6541` and includes:

1. **Pill-shaped button** with terracotta (`Color.Voxa.accent`) background using `Capsule()` shape
2. **Microphone icon with pulse animation** - Circle scales and fades with `repeatForever` animation when recording
3. **Keyboard shortcut badge** showing "⌘⇧Space" in a semi-transparent white capsule
4. **Hover lift effect** - Shadow radius increases (6→12), scale effect (1.0→1.02), and Y offset (-2) on hover
5. **Recording functionality** connected via NotificationCenter:
   - Posts `.toggleRecording` notification when button is tapped
   - Subscribes to `.recordingStateChanged` notification to update button state
   - Button text changes to "Stop Recording" and color changes to red when recording

All acceptance criteria have been verified:
- ✅ Button triggers recording
- ✅ Hover state with lift effect
- ✅ Shows Stop Recording when active

**Note:** There are still 6 remaining stories in Phase 11 (US-803 through US-808), so the overall PRD is not complete.
