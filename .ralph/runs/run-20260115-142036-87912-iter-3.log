## Summary

**US-803: Recent Transcriptions List** has been completed successfully.

### What was done:
- Verified that the US-803 implementation was already complete in the codebase
- The implementation includes:
  - **Section header** using `Font.Voxa.sectionHeaderItalic` (18pt serif italic) for "Recent Transcriptions"
  - **View All link** that navigates to the History tab via `.navigateToHistory` notification
  - **RecentTranscriptionItem component** with icon, title, subtitle (word count + duration), and timestamp
  - **Hover states** that highlight the background and change title color to accent
  - **Empty state** with helpful message when no transcriptions exist
  - Shows last 3-5 transcriptions from `UsageStatsManager.shared.recentEntries`
- Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to mark US-803 as complete with detailed implementation notes
- Verified build passes with `swift build`

### Commits:
- `282de7d` feat(US-803): mark Recent Transcriptions List as complete
- `4665c09` docs: add US-803 progress log entry and activity log

### Remaining stories:
5 stories remain unchecked in the PRD (US-804 through US-808), so the completion signal is not output.
