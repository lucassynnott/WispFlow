US-705 is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

**US-705: Migrate Text Cleanup Settings Section** has been verified as complete.

### What was implemented:
The `TextCleanupSettingsSummary` view was expanded from a simple summary to a full settings section with four subsections:

1. **Cleanup Toggle Section** - Enable/disable toggle with status badge
2. **Filler Word Removal Section** - Card-based mode picker (Basic, Standard, Thorough, AI-Powered)
3. **Post-Processing Section** - Three toggles (auto-capitalize, add period, trim whitespace)
4. **Preview Section** - Before/after text comparison showing cleanup effects

### Verification:
- ✅ `swift build` - PASS
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met:
  - Cleanup toggle works
  - Filler word options functional
  - Post-processing toggles persist

### Commits:
- `8df6cd0` - Main implementation (feat: Migrate Text Cleanup Settings Section)
- `b29741c` - Progress log documentation

The working tree is clean. There are 4 remaining unchecked stories in the PRD (US-706, US-707, US-708, US-709), so the completion signal is not output.
