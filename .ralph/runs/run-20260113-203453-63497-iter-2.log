There are still unchecked stories (US-403 through US-410), so I should not output the completion signal. The task is complete - I have successfully implemented US-402: Refined Menu Bar Experience.

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-402: Refined Menu Bar Experience** with the following changes:

1. **Custom menu bar icon tinting** - Applied warm charcoal (#2D3436) for ready state, coral accent (#E07A5F) for recording state, and textSecondary for other states using the NSColor.Wispflow design palette

2. **Redesigned dropdown menu** - Added SF Symbol icons to menu items (gearshape for Settings, mic for Audio Input, arrow.counterclockwise.circle for Launch at Login, power for Quit) with warm gray tinting

3. **Recording state with coral pulsing glow** - Implemented a Timer-based sine wave animation that varies both alpha (0.7-1.0) and coral brightness for a smooth pulsing glow effect during recording

4. **Commits made:**
   - `b66dbd6` - feat(US-402): add refined menu bar experience with warm colors and pulse animation
   - `f096711` - docs: update progress log for US-402
