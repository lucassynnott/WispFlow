There are still 16 more user stories remaining in the PRD that are not yet complete. Therefore, I should NOT output the `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` signal since only US-509 was the selected story for this run and there are more remaining.

US-509 is fully complete. Let me summarize:

## Summary

**US-509: Permission Status UI** was already implemented in a previous iteration (run 20260114-121455-84404, iteration 4). 

The implementation includes:
- `PermissionStatusRow` SwiftUI component showing permission status with visual indicators
- Green checkmark icon (✓) when permission is granted, red X icon (✗) when denied
- "Grant Permission" button that appears only when permission is not granted
- Button triggers `PermissionManager.requestMicrophonePermission()` or `requestAccessibilityPermission()` to open System Settings
- Status auto-updates via app activation observer when user returns from System Settings, plus background polling

All acceptance criteria verified:
- ✅ Microphone permission status shown with icon (✓ green / ✗ red)
- ✅ Accessibility permission status shown with icon  
- ✅ "Grant Permission" button shown when permission not granted
- ✅ Button opens appropriate System Settings pane
- ✅ Status updates automatically when user grants permission and returns
- ✅ Typecheck passes (`swift build` succeeds)
