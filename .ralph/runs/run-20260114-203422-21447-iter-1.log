## Summary

**US-606: Language Selection** has been verified as complete with all acceptance criteria met:

1. ✅ **Language dropdown in Settings** - `LanguagePicker` component in `TranscriptionSettingsView` bound to `whisperManager.selectedLanguage` with Auto-Detect + 11 common languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Arabic)

2. ✅ **Pass language hint to WhisperKit** - `transcribe()` method creates `DecodingOptions` with `language: selectedLanguage.whisperLanguageCode` (nil for auto-detect) and `detectLanguage: true/false`

3. ✅ **Remember language preference** - `selectedLanguage` property persisted to UserDefaults with key `selectedTranscriptionLanguage` via didSet observer

4. ✅ **Auto-detect as default** - `.automatic` case is the default value in `WhisperManager.init()`

**Verification:**
