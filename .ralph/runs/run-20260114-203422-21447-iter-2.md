## Summary

**US-607: Transcription Post-Processing** has been verified as complete with all acceptance criteria met:

1. ✅ **Option to auto-capitalize first letter** - `autoCapitalizeFirstLetter` @Published property in `TextCleanupManager` with toggle in Settings UI

2. ✅ **Option to add period at end of sentences** - `addPeriodAtEnd` @Published property in `TextCleanupManager` with toggle in Settings UI

3. ✅ **Option to trim leading/trailing whitespace** - `trimWhitespace` @Published property in `TextCleanupManager` with toggle in Settings UI

4. ✅ **Configurable in Settings** - "Post-Processing Options" card in Text Cleanup Settings tab with all three toggles

**Implementation Details:**
- All three options stored in UserDefaults with keys: `postProcessAutoCapitalizeFirstLetter`, `postProcessAddPeriodAtEnd`, `postProcessTrimWhitespace`
- All options default to `true` for optimal UX out of the box
- `applyPostProcessing(_:)` method applies options in order: trim whitespace → capitalize first letter → add period at end
- `processText(_:)` method combines cleanup (if enabled) + post-processing for full pipeline
- Post-processing runs independently of cleanup mode (even if cleanup is disabled)

**Files Changed:**
- `Sources/WispFlow/TextCleanupManager.swift` - Added post-processing properties, methods, and UserDefaults persistence
- `Sources/WispFlow/SettingsWindow.swift` - Added "Post-Processing Options" card with three toggles
- `.ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Added US-607 section with tasks and notes
- `.agents/tasks/prd-wispflow-improvements-v2.md` - Marked US-607 acceptance criteria complete

**Verification:**
- `swift build` -> PASS (Build complete! 1.71s)

The implementation was completed in a prior parallel iteration. This run verified all acceptance criteria are met and documentation is up to date.
