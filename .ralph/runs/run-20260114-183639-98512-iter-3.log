## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-603: Recording Timeout Safety** for WispFlow. The implementation prevents runaway recordings that could fill disk space by:

1. **Maximum recording duration** of 5 minutes (300 seconds) - configurable via `AudioManager.maxRecordingDuration` which persists to UserDefaults
2. **Warning toast at 4 minutes** - displays "Recording Limit Approaching - 1 minute remaining" via `showRecordingTimeoutWarning`
3. **Auto-stop and transcribe at limit** - triggers the same stop flow as manual stop, automatically transcribing the audio
4. **Elapsed time display** - the RecordingIndicatorWindow already displays elapsed time via its `durationLabel` component

**Files changed:**
- `AudioManager.swift` - Added timeout constants, timer properties, callbacks, and configuration methods
- `AppDelegate.swift` - Wired up timeout callbacks to show toasts and trigger auto-stop
- `ToastView.swift` - Added `showRecordingTimeoutWarning` and `showRecordingAutoStopped` toast methods
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Added and completed US-603 section
- `prd-wispflow-improvements-v2.md` - Marked US-603 and all acceptance criteria complete

**Commits:**
- `213e0a7 feat(US-603): implement recording timeout safety`
- `0946822 docs: add verification progress log for US-603 iteration 3`
