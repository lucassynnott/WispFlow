US-708 is complete. The story was already implemented in previous iterations (commits 921fea8, 985b1f2, 98e61a7). In this iteration, I:

1. Verified the implementation was complete
2. Updated the Implementation Notes in the plan to accurately reflect what was done
3. Confirmed the build passes
4. Added a progress log entry documenting the verification

All stories in the implementation plan are now complete (including US-709 which was completed by a parallel agent). Since all stories are complete, I should output the completion signal.

**Summary of US-708 Implementation:**
- **Deleted `SettingsWindow.swift` entirely** - the file was removed as all settings are now integrated in MainWindow
- **Removed `SettingsOpenFullButton`** component from MainWindow.swift 
- **Removed `settingsWindowController`** property and initialization from AppDelegate
- **Updated `AppDelegate.openSettings()`** to call `openMainWindow(initialNavItem: .settings)` instead of the separate settings window
- **Updated `MainWindowController.showMainWindow(initialNavItem:)`** to accept an optional NavigationItem parameter for direct navigation
- Menu bar "Settings..." now opens the main window with Settings tab selected
- Build passes with all changes

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
