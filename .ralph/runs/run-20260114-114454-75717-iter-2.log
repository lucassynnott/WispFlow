There are still 23 uncompleted stories in the PRD, so I should not output the completion signal. The task for US-502: Audio Device Caching has been completed successfully.

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-502: Audio Device Caching** for WispFlow:

**Changes made to `AudioManager.swift`:**
- Added `cachedSuccessfulDevice: AudioInputDevice?` in-memory cache property
- Added `usedCachedDeviceForCapture: Bool` flag to track cache usage per session
- Added `invalidateDeviceCache(reason:)` method with formatted logging
- Added `cacheSuccessfulDevice(_:)` to cache device after successful recording
- Added `getCachedDeviceIfAvailable()` for fast-path device retrieval
- Added `getDeviceForRecording()` with priority: user-selected → cached → smart selection
- Cache invalidated on: manual device change, device disconnect, or device setting failure
- Device cached only after successful non-silent recordings

**Commits:**
- `4dcdba0` feat(US-502): add audio device caching for fast recording start
- `a8ef71d` docs: update progress log for US-502

All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ Last successfully used device cached in memory
- ✅ Cache used for fast-path device selection on next recording
- ✅ Cache invalidated when user manually changes device in Settings
- ✅ Cache invalidated when cached device disconnected
- ✅ First recording: full enumeration (~100-200ms)
- ✅ Subsequent recordings: cached device (~10-20ms)
- ✅ Typecheck passes
