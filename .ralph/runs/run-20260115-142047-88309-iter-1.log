There are still 7 unchecked stories remaining in the implementation plan (US-802 through US-808), so I should not output the completion signal.

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting**.

### What was implemented:
1. **Time-based greeting** with period ending:
   - "Good morning." (before 12pm)
   - "Good afternoon." (12pm-5pm)
   - "Good evening." (after 5pm)

2. **Subtitle with last session info**:
   - Format: "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was X ago."
   - Negative case: "Ready to capture your thoughts?" when no previous session

3. **Header layout matching design**:
   - DASHBOARD label (uppercase, tracking-widest)
   - Date in top-right (e.g., "Thursday, January 15")
   - System Active status with green dot indicator
   - Serif display font (52pt) for editorial Playfair Display style

### Verification:
- `swift build` → PASS

### Commit:
