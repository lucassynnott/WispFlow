There are still 12 uncompleted stories in the PRD (US-514 through US-525). US-513 is now complete but it was not the last story, so we should not output the completion signal.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **US-513: Clipboard Preservation** for WispFlow. The changes included:

1. **Updated default restore delay** from 500ms to 800ms as per the acceptance criteria
2. **Refactored clipboard restoration** to use a true background thread (`DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility)`) for the delay, followed by main thread dispatch for the actual pasteboard operations
3. **Added helper method** `restoreClipboardContentsSync(items:)` for cleaner separation of concerns
4. **Enhanced logging** with `[US-513]` tags throughout the clipboard preservation flow for debugging

**Commits:**
- `8f0edae feat(US-513): implement clipboard preservation`
- `6a6a6f8 docs: update progress log for US-513`

**Verification:** `swift build` → PASS (with only an informational warning about NSPasteboardItem not conforming to Sendable, which is expected for AppKit classes)
