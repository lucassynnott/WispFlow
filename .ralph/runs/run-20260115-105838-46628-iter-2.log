US-634 is complete. The implementation plan still has US-635 and US-636 remaining.

## Summary

I successfully implemented **US-634: Transcription History View** for the WispFlow application. The implementation includes:

1. **Extended TranscriptionEntry data model** with `fullText` field, migration support, and methods for search/grouping
2. **DateCategory enum** for grouping entries by Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, and Older
3. **Full HistoryContentView** with header, search bar, empty state, and grouped history list
4. **HistoryEntryCard component** with:
   - Preview and expanded text views
   - Copy to clipboard functionality with toast notification
   - Delete with confirmation dialog
   - Search query highlighting
   - Hover effects and smooth animations

All acceptance criteria are met:
- ✅ Past transcriptions listed with date/time/preview
- ✅ Search filters results in real-time  
- ✅ Copy and delete work correctly
- ✅ Entries grouped by date
- ✅ Empty state message when no history
