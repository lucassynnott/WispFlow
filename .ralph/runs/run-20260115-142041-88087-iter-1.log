There are 7 remaining stories (US-802 through US-808) in Phase 11. Since there are unchecked stories remaining, I should NOT output the completion signal.

## Summary

**US-801: Home Dashboard Header with Time-Based Greeting** has been verified as complete.

The story was already implemented by a parallel agent in commit `4326ecb`. This run verified:

1. ✅ **Time-based greeting logic** - `greetingMessage` returns "Good morning.", "Good afternoon.", or "Good evening." based on time of day (morning <12pm, afternoon 12-5pm, evening >5pm)

2. ✅ **Playfair Display font for greeting** - `Font.Voxa.displayGreeting` (52pt serif font) provides editorial typography

3. ✅ **Subtitle with last session info** - `lastSessionSubtitle` shows "Ready to capture your thoughts? Your last session was X ago." with relative time formatting

4. ✅ **DASHBOARD label** - Uppercase text with `.tracking(4)` for wide letter spacing

5. ✅ **Date and System Active status** - Top-right shows formatted date and green dot indicator with "System Active"

**Build verification:** PASS (`swift build` completes successfully)
**Commit:** 4326ecb (already committed by parallel agent)
**Post-commit status:** clean
