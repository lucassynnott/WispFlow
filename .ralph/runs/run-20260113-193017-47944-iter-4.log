There are still 2 more stories in the PRD (US-305, US-306), so this is not the final story. The task is complete.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **US-304: Fix Whisper Model Downloads**. Here's what was done:

**WhisperManager.swift changes:**
- Added `lastErrorMessage` published property for detailed error display
- Added `verifyModelsDirectory()` to check directory exists and is writable before download
- Added `verifyModelFilesAfterDownload()` to verify model files and log their sizes
- Added `createDetailedErrorMessage()` for user-friendly error messages with cause analysis and suggestions
- Added `retryLoadModel()` method to retry failed downloads
- Added comprehensive boxed logging at download start, success, and failure with model info, directory status, and download URL
- Added intermediate status messages during download ("Connecting...", "Downloading...", "Still downloading...")

**SettingsWindow.swift changes:**
- Added `ProgressView` progress bar shown during download with percentage
- Added error alert that shows automatically when download fails
- Added "Retry Download" button when in error state
- Added "Error Details" button to view error info after dismissing initial alert

**Commits:**
- `b05cd63` feat(US-304): add Whisper model download error handling, progress bar, and retry
- `c7e87bc` docs: update progress log for US-304
