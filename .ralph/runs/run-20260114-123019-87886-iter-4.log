There are still uncompleted stories in the PRD (US-513 through US-525), so I should not output the completion signal. The task for US-512 is complete.

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-512: Hotkey Conflict Detection**:

1. **Added system shortcuts list** - Created `SystemShortcut` struct and defined 27+ common macOS system shortcuts including Spotlight (Cmd+Space), App Switcher (Cmd+Tab), screenshots, Mission Control, and standard app shortcuts (Copy/Paste/etc.)

2. **Implemented conflict detection** - Added `checkForConflicts(_:)` and `hasConflicts(_:)` static methods to HotkeyManager

3. **Updated HotkeyRecorderView** - Added conflict warning UI with:
   - State tracking for pending configuration and conflicts
   - SwiftUI alert that shows conflicting shortcut names and descriptions
   - "Use Anyway" button to proceed despite warning
   - "Cancel" button to reject the conflicting hotkey

4. **Verified Reset to Default** - Confirmed existing button correctly restores Cmd+Shift+Space

5. **Typecheck passes** - `swift build` completes successfully with no errors or warnings
