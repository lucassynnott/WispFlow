## Summary

US-704: Migrate Transcription Settings Section has been verified complete. The implementation was already done in a parallel run (commit `57d7c57`).

**What was implemented:**
- **TranscriptionSettingsSummary** in `MainWindow.swift` was expanded from a simple summary view to a full settings section with 4 subsections:
  1. **Model Selection Section**: Card-based Whisper model picker (Tiny, Base, Small, Medium) with size/speed/accuracy specs
  2. **Model Actions Section**: Download/Load buttons with gradient progress bar and error handling
  3. **Language Selection Section**: Dropdown with 12 languages, flags, and persistence via WhisperManager
  4. **Quality vs Speed Section**: Tradeoff info with dynamic highlighting based on selected model

**New Components Created:**
- `TranscriptionModelCard` - Card-based model selection with hover effects and status badges
- `TranscriptionModelBadge` - Status badges for Active/Downloaded states
- `TranscriptionModelSpec` - Small spec indicators (size, speed, accuracy)
- `TranscriptionProgressBar` - Gradient progress bar with shimmer effect
- `TranscriptionLanguagePicker` - Language dropdown with flags

**Verification:**
