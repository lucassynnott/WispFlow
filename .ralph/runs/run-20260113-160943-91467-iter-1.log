There are still 6 more stories to complete (US-002 through US-007). This was only US-001, so I should NOT output the completion signal. The task is complete for US-001 but not all stories.

**Summary:**

Completed US-001: Menu Bar App Foundation. The implementation includes:
- NSStatusItem-based menu bar presence with microphone SF Symbol icons
- Recording state toggle (idle/recording) with icon changes on left-click
- Right-click context menu with Settings, Launch at Login, and Quit options
- SMAppService integration for launch at login capability
- LSUIElement=true for dock-less operation

All acceptance criteria verified via `swift build` and `./scripts/build-app.sh`. Commit: `bed64b9 feat(US-001): implement menu bar app foundation`. Working tree is clean. 6 more stories remain unchecked in the PRD.
