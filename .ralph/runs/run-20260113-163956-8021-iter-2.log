US-006: Text Insertion is complete. US-007 is still remaining, so I should not output the COMPLETE signal.

## Summary

Successfully implemented US-006: Text Insertion for WispFlow:

1. **Created TextInserter.swift** - Core service for text insertion via pasteboard (Cmd+V simulation) using CGEvent
2. **Accessibility permission handling** - Using AXIsProcessTrusted/AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions with guidance alerts to System Settings
3. **Clipboard preservation** - Saves and restores original clipboard contents with configurable delay (0.2-2.0s)
4. **Settings UI** - Added Text Insertion tab in SettingsWindow with permission status, clipboard options, and feature description
5. **Integration** - Connected to AppDelegate workflow: after text cleanup, automatically inserts cleaned text into active application

The implementation works in any text field (Slack, email, VS Code, browsers, Notes) and properly handles errors with user-friendly alerts.
