There are still many incomplete stories (US-607 through US-631 are not checked off). Since US-606 is complete but the PRD has more unchecked stories, I should NOT output the `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` signal.

**Summary:**

US-606: Language Selection is **complete**. The feature was already implemented in prior parallel iterations (commit c54111c). This run verified:

1. ✅ **Language dropdown in Settings** - `LanguagePicker` component with Auto-detect + 11 common languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Arabic)

2. ✅ **Pass language hint to WhisperKit** - The `transcribe()` method creates `DecodingOptions` with:
   - `language`: The Whisper language code (or nil for auto-detect)
   - `detectLanguage`: true for automatic mode, false for specific language

3. ✅ **Remember language preference** - Language selection persisted via `UserDefaults` under key `selectedTranscriptionLanguage`

4. ✅ **"Auto-detect" as default** - `TranscriptionLanguage.automatic` is the default value

**Verification:** `swift build` passes (Build complete! 0.12s)
**Commit:** ba76845 docs: add verification logs for US-606 run 21195
**Post-commit status:** clean
ft - TranscriptionLanguage enum, selectedLanguage property, DecodingOptions in transcribe()
- Sources/WispFlow/SettingsWindow.swift - LanguagePicker bound to $whisperManager.selectedLanguage
