All 38 stories are complete. Now I can output the completion signal.

## Summary

I successfully verified and documented the completion of **US-636: Custom Dictionary View** for WispFlow. The implementation was already present in the codebase:

### What was implemented:
- **DictionaryManager.swift**: Complete singleton for dictionary storage and management
  - `DictionaryEntry` data model with id, word, optional pronunciationHint, timestamps
  - Full CRUD operations (createEntry, updateEntry, deleteEntry)
  - Search functionality via `searchEntries(query:)`
  - Duplicate validation via `wordExists(_:excludingEntryId:)`
  - Import/export: `exportAsText()`, `importFromText()`, `exportAsJSON()`, `importFromJSON()`
  - UserDefaults persistence with max 1000 entries
  - Automatic alphabetical sorting by word

- **DictionaryContentView** in MainWindow.swift:
  - Header with Import/Export buttons, Add Word button
  - Search bar with real-time filtering
  - Word count badge and last updated timestamp
  - Empty state explaining feature benefits
  - No search results state with clear button
  - LazyVStack list of dictionary entries

- **Supporting components**:
  - `DictionaryEntryRow`: Entry display with hover effects, edit/delete buttons, search highlighting
  - `CreateDictionaryEntrySheet`: New entry form with validation
  - `EditDictionaryEntrySheet`: Edit form with change tracking and metadata
  - Delete confirmation alert

### Verification:
- `swift build` → PASS
- Commit: `a95b5af` docs: add progress log for US-636 Custom Dictionary View
- Post-commit status: clean

All 38 stories in the Implementation Plan are now complete.

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
