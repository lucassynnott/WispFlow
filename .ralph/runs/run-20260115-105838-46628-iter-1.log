There are still 3 unchecked stories remaining (US-634, US-635, US-636), so we should NOT output the COMPLETE signal.

US-633: Dashboard Home View has already been fully implemented and committed in a previous iteration. The working tree is clean and the story is complete with:

- **Commit**: `8273583 feat(US-633): Dashboard Home View with usage statistics and activity timeline`
- **Build verification**: PASS (`swift build` succeeds)
- **All acceptance criteria verified**:
  - ✅ Welcome message displayed at top
  - ✅ Usage stats visible (streak, words, WPM)
  - ✅ Quick action cards functional with hover effects
  - ✅ Recent activity shows dated entries
  - ✅ Empty state shows onboarding prompt

Since the story was already completed in a previous run and everything is in order (clean git status, build passes, all criteria met), no additional work is needed.

**Summary**: US-633 Dashboard Home View is complete. The implementation includes:
- `UsageStatsManager.swift` - Singleton for tracking usage statistics (streak days, words transcribed, WPM, recent entries)
- `HomeContentView` in `MainWindow.swift` - Full dashboard UI with welcome section, stats row, quick actions, and activity timeline
- `AppDelegate` integration - Recording duration tracking and stats recording after transcription
