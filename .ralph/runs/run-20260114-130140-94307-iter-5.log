The build passes and working tree has only log files which are modified automatically. The main implementation and documentation files are clean.

**Summary:**

US-519 (Accessibility Permission Step) has been **verified complete**. The implementation was already present from a previous iteration with all acceptance criteria met:

✅ Screen explains why accessibility access is needed (hotkeys + text insertion)  
✅ Current permission status displayed  
✅ "Open System Settings" button opens Accessibility pane  
✅ Instructions: "Enable WispFlow in the list"  
✅ Status updates when user returns to app  
✅ "Continue" enabled only after permission granted (or "Skip" available)  
✅ Typecheck passes (swift build succeeds)

The commit was `2dcb5db feat(US-519): implement accessibility permission step for onboarding wizard` and the progress log has been updated. The working tree is clean for source files.
