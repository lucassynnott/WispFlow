## Summary

**US-515: Text Insertion Fallback** was already fully implemented and committed in a previous iteration (`0eb7f5b feat(US-515): implement text insertion fallback mechanism`). 

This run verified:
- ✅ Primary method: Cmd+V paste simulation via CGEvent in `simulatePaste()`
- ✅ Fallback: `InsertionResult.fallbackToManualPaste` case with `showManualPasteRequired()` toast  
- ✅ Error logging: `logSimulationError()` method with formatted box output
- ✅ User toast: "Text copied - press Cmd+V to paste" (5-second duration)
- ✅ Typecheck passes: `swift build` completed successfully

**Commit:** `25f2c37 docs: update progress log for US-515 verification`
**Post-commit status:** clean

There are still 10 unchecked stories remaining (US-516 through US-525 in Phases 5 and 6), so the PRD is not yet complete.
