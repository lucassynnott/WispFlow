There are still unchecked stories (US-702 through US-709), so I should NOT output the completion signal.

## Summary

**US-701: Create SettingsContentView for Main Window** has been verified as complete. 

The implementation was already done in a previous run (commit `62147f5`), which included:
- **SettingsContentView** with a full ScrollView layout for smooth vertical scrolling
- **6 expandable sections** using `SettingsSectionView` component:
  - General (app info, hotkey, permissions)
  - Audio (input device, device count, calibration)
  - Transcription (Whisper model with status, language with flag)
  - Text Cleanup (cleanup toggle, mode, post-processing badges)
  - Text Insertion (paste method, clipboard preservation)
  - Debug (debug mode, auto-save, last recording info)
- **wispflowCard() styling** via background colors, shadows, and rounded corners
- **Color.Wispflow design tokens** used throughout for consistent theming
- **Supporting components**: SettingsInfoRow, PermissionBadge, ModelStatusIndicator, StatusPill, MiniFeatureBadge, SettingsOpenFullButton

All acceptance criteria are met:
- ✅ Settings display in main window content area
- ✅ All 6 sections visible with clear headers
- ✅ Consistent styling with other main window views
- ✅ Smooth scrolling for long content

**Verification**: Build passes (`swift build` succeeds)  
**Commit**: `4fc9260 docs: add progress log for US-701 verification run`  
**Post-commit status**: clean
