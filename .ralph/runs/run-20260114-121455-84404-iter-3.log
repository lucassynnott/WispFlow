There are still 17 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD, so US-508 was not the last story. I should not output the completion signal.

## Summary

Successfully completed US-508: Open System Settings Helper. The implementation was already in place in `PermissionManager.swift` from the previous US-507 work. This iteration:

1. **Verified the existing implementation** of `openMicrophoneSettings()` and `openAccessibilitySettings()` methods
2. **Confirmed URL scheme compatibility** with macOS 13+ (Ventura and later) via web search
3. **Confirmed fallback logic** exists for graceful degradation if specific pane URLs fail
4. **Updated implementation plan** with detailed notes marking US-508 complete
5. **Updated PRD** with all acceptance criteria checked
6. **Committed changes**: 
   - `c492af8` feat(US-508): verify and document Open System Settings Helper
   - `7baa5c7` docs: update progress log for US-508
7. **Working tree is clean** after commit
