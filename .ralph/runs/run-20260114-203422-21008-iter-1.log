## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-606: Language Selection** for WispFlow. The changes include:

1. **Wired up language persistence** - Connected the Settings UI's `LanguagePicker` to `WhisperManager.selectedLanguage` (which already had UserDefaults persistence implemented)

2. **Removed duplicate enum** - Deleted the duplicate `TranscriptionLanguage` enum from SettingsWindow.swift and updated `LanguagePicker` and `LanguageRow` to use `WhisperManager.TranscriptionLanguage`

3. **Language hint to WhisperKit** - Verified that the `transcribe()` method already creates `DecodingOptions` with the selected language code (or nil for auto-detect)

All acceptance criteria verified:
- ✅ Language dropdown in Settings (Auto-detect + 11 common languages)
- ✅ Pass language hint to WhisperKit (via `DecodingOptions`)
- ✅ Remember language preference (persisted via UserDefaults)
- ✅ "Auto-detect" as default

**Commit**: `c54111c feat(US-606): implement language selection for transcription`
