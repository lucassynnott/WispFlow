**Summary:**

Successfully implemented US-004: Local Whisper Transcription for WispFlow. Key changes:

1. **Integrated WhisperKit** (argmaxinc/WhisperKit) via Swift Package Manager - a CoreML-optimized Whisper implementation for Apple Silicon
2. **Created WhisperManager.swift** - wrapper class handling model loading, transcription pipeline, and status management
3. **Created SettingsWindow.swift** - SwiftUI-based settings UI with model selection (tiny/base/small/medium), download/delete controls, and status display
4. **Connected transcription to recording flow** - when recording stops, audio is automatically transcribed via WhisperKit
5. **Updated minimum macOS to 14.0** (WhisperKit requirement)

The app now supports:
- Multiple Whisper model sizes with auto-download from Hugging Face
- Model management UI accessible from Settings menu
- "Transcribing..." indicator during processing
- Error handling that guides users to Settings if model not loaded

There are 3 remaining stories in the PRD (US-005, US-006, US-007), so this is not the final completion.
