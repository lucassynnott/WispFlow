US-403: Beautiful Recording Indicator has been successfully completed.

**Summary of changes:**
- Redesigned the recording indicator as an elegant floating pill with frosted glass effect and warm ivory tint overlay
- Replaced the bar-based audio level meter with a smooth, animated `LiveWaveformView` that creates an organic flowing wave effect responding to audio level
- Added warm coral (#E07A5F) recording dot with gentle pulse animation (opacity and scale modulation)
- Created `HoverGlowButton` with coral glow on hover and scale animation on press
- Implemented slide-down animation on appear and slide-up on dismiss (0.35s duration)
- Added recording duration display with elegant typography
- Added drop shadow for floating effect
- Window size increased to 240x52 with 26px corner radius for better proportions
