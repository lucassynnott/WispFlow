## Summary

I successfully completed **US-604: Audio Level Calibration** for WispFlow. The implementation was already present in the codebase from a previous iteration, so this run focused on verification, documentation updates, and committing the changes.

**Key findings:**
- All 5 acceptance criteria were already implemented in `AudioManager.swift` and `SettingsWindow.swift`
- "Calibrate" button is present in the Audio settings tab via `AudioCalibrationCard`
- 3-second ambient noise measurement is implemented in `startCalibration()` 
- Silence threshold is calculated as ambient + 5dB offset in `finishCalibration()`
- Per-device calibration is stored in UserDefaults keyed by device UID
- Reset to defaults option via `resetCalibrationForCurrentDevice()`

**Changes committed:**
- `fb0d87a feat(US-604): implement audio level calibration`
- `2814a66 docs: add verification progress log for US-604 iteration 1`

**Verification:** `swift build` passes (only warnings, no errors)
