## Summary

**US-512: Hotkey Conflict Detection** was already fully implemented in a previous iteration (commit `c1c5fd9`). This run verified that all acceptance criteria are met:

1. ✅ **Common system shortcuts detected** - 27+ system shortcuts defined in `HotkeyManager.systemShortcuts` including Spotlight (Cmd+Space), App Switcher (Cmd+Tab), screenshots, and standard app shortcuts
2. ✅ **Warning shown when conflicting hotkey recorded** - SwiftUI alert with `showConflictWarning` state variable shows conflict details
3. ✅ **User can proceed despite warning** - "Use Anyway" button calls `applyPendingConfig()` to apply the conflicting hotkey
4. ✅ **"Reset to Default" button restores Cmd+Shift+Space** - Button exists calling `hotkeyManager.resetToDefault()`
5. ✅ **Typecheck passes** - `swift build` completed successfully
