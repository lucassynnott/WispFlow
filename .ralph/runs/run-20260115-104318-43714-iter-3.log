There are still 3 unchecked stories remaining (US-634, US-635, US-636). This was not the last story, so I should not output the completion signal.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented **US-633: Dashboard Home View** for WispFlow. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `UsageStatsManager.swift`** - A new singleton manager that tracks:
   - Streak days (consecutive days of transcription usage)
   - Total words transcribed
   - Total recording duration and average WPM
   - Recent transcription entries with 50-entry limit
   - UserDefaults persistence across app restarts

2. **Updated `HomeContentView` in `MainWindow.swift`** with a complete dashboard:
   - Time-based welcome greeting with current date
   - Stats row with 4 cards (streak, words, avg WPM, recordings)
   - Empty state with onboarding prompt for new users
   - Feature banner promoting AI-powered text cleanup
   - Quick Actions section with 4 cards and hover lift effects
   - Recent Activity timeline grouped by date with expandable entries

3. **Integrated stats tracking in `AppDelegate.swift`**:
   - Recording duration is now tracked through the transcription flow
   - Stats are recorded after successful text insertion

### Verification:
- `swift build` passes successfully
- All acceptance criteria met
- Committed as `8273583 feat(US-633): Dashboard Home View with usage statistics and activity timeline`
