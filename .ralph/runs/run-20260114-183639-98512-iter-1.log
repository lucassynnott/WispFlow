## Summary

I successfully implemented **US-601: Audio Device Hot-Plug Support** for WispFlow. The implementation includes:

1. **Added `preferredDeviceUID`** - Stores the user's preferred device UID separately from the runtime `selectedDeviceUID`, enabling automatic device reconnection
2. **Device disconnect during recording** - Detects when the active audio device is disconnected during an active recording session and automatically falls back to the system default device
3. **Preferred device reconnection** - When the user's preferred device is reconnected, automatically switches back to it (if not currently recording)
4. **Toast notifications** - Added three new toast notification methods to inform users about device changes
5. **Callbacks** - Added `onDeviceDisconnectedDuringRecording`, `onDeviceChanged`, and `onPreferredDeviceReconnected` callbacks wired up in AppDelegate

**Files changed:**
- `Sources/WispFlow/AudioManager.swift` (main hot-plug logic)
- `Sources/WispFlow/AppDelegate.swift` (callback wiring)
- `Sources/WispFlow/ToastView.swift` (toast methods)
- `.agents/tasks/prd-wispflow-improvements-v2.md` (acceptance criteria checked)
- `.ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (added US-601 section)

**Commit:** `19b0536 feat(US-601): implement audio device hot-plug support`
