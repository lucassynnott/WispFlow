# Implementation Plan - WispFlow v0.5

## Summary

WispFlow v0.4 (US-301 through US-306) is complete with unified audio buffer architecture, tap verification, buffer integrity logging, model download improvements, and audio debug export.

**v0.5 focuses on a comprehensive UI refresh to transform WispFlow into a polished, premium macOS application:**

1. **No Design System Exists**: The codebase has no centralized design tokens. All colors, fonts, spacing, and styles are hardcoded inline throughout `SettingsWindow.swift`, `RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift`, and `StatusBarController.swift`.

2. **Current UI State**:
   - Settings window: 520x580 pixels, uses default SwiftUI Form/Section styling
   - Recording indicator: NSPanel with NSVisualEffectView (.hudWindow material), standard SF Symbols
   - Menu bar: Standard NSStatusItem with system icons
   - No custom theming, no warm color palette, no custom animations

3. **Key Gaps vs PRD Requirements**:
   - Missing: DesignSystem.swift with color/typography/spacing tokens
   - Missing: Warm ivory/cream (#FEFCF8) background instead of default system colors
   - Missing: Coral accent (#E07A5F) instead of system blue
   - Missing: Custom button styles (WispflowButtonStyle)
   - Missing: Card-based section styling with soft shadows
   - Missing: Custom toggle switches with coral accent
   - Missing: Toast notification system
   - Missing: Live waveform visualization (current is simple bar meter)
   - Missing: Micro-interactions and button press animations
   - Missing: Welcome/onboarding flow (lower priority for MVP)

### Priority Order (based on design dependency graph):
1. **US-401 (Design System Foundation)** - All other stories depend on this
2. **US-404 (Modern Settings Window)** - Largest visual impact, uses design system
3. **US-403 (Beautiful Recording Indicator)** - High visibility during use
4. **US-402 (Refined Menu Bar Experience)** - AppKit/NSStatusItem changes
5. **US-405-408 (Settings Tab Polish)** - Incremental improvements per tab
6. **US-409 (Toast Notification System)** - New component
7. **US-410 (Micro-interactions & Polish)** - Final polish pass

## Notes

### Discoveries

1. **No Existing Design System**: The codebase has no centralized color/font/spacing definitions. All styling is inline with system defaults. US-401 must be completed first as all other stories depend on it.

2. **AppKit + SwiftUI Mix**: The app uses both AppKit (NSPanel, NSStatusItem, NSVisualEffectView) and SwiftUI (Settings views). Design system must provide both Color/Font and NSColor/NSFont equivalents.

3. **Settings Window Uses Form**: Current SettingsWindow.swift uses SwiftUI Form/Section which has limited customization. May need to replace with VStack/HStack for full design control.

4. **Recording Indicator is AppKit**: RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift is pure AppKit (NSPanel, NSView, NSTextField). Will need to update using NSColor equivalents from design system.

5. **Audio Level Meter Exists**: `AudioLevelMeterView` already exists with color-coded levels. Just needs color updates to use design system palette.

6. **No Toast System**: There is no existing notification/toast system. US-409 requires building from scratch.

7. **Onboarding Not in MVP**: The PRD mentions onboarding/welcome flow (section 4 under Core UI Components) but it's not in the MVP scope stories. Should be deferred to v0.6.

### Risks

1. **SwiftUI TabView Limitations**: SwiftUI's TabView has limited customization options. May not be able to fully style tab bar as desired without custom implementation.

2. **NSVisualEffectView Tinting**: Warm tinting of NSVisualEffectView may be limited. May need alternative approach for frosted glass with warm tint.

3. **Performance of Animations**: Need to ensure micro-interactions don't impact transcription performance. Animations should be lightweight.

4. **Consistency Across macOS Versions**: Need to test visual appearance on macOS 14.0 and later to ensure consistent rendering.

### Technical Notes

- Use `Color(red:green:blue:)` initializer with hex conversion for precise color matching
- SwiftUI `.shadow()` modifier for card shadows
- `NSColor(srgbRed:green:blue:alpha:)` for AppKit equivalents
- `.animation(.spring(response:dampingFraction:))` for micro-interactions
- Consider `@Environment(\.colorScheme)` for future dark mode support (not in v0.5 scope)
