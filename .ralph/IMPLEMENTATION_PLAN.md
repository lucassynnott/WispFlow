# Implementation Plan - WispFlow v0.2

## Summary

WispFlow v0.1 (US-001 through US-007) is complete with core functionality: menu bar app, global hotkey, audio capture, WhisperKit transcription, rule-based text cleanup, text insertion, and settings persistence.

**v0.2 focuses on fixing the critical transcription issue** where recordings return "[BLANK_AUDIO]" instead of actual text. The PRD identifies root causes in audio format/preprocessing and WhisperKit configuration. Additionally, v0.2 adds debug capabilities and local LLM cleanup.

### Key Gaps to Address:
1. **Audio debugging** - No audio level meter, silence detection, or waveform visualization
2. **Audio preprocessing** - Need validation of 16kHz conversion and Float32 normalization
3. **Model loading UX** - Auto-load exists but lacks menu bar progress indicator and "Model Ready" status
4. **Error handling** - BLANK_AUDIO provides no helpful feedback; need meaningful error messages
5. **Debug mode** - No audio export or diagnostic logging for troubleshooting
6. **LLM cleanup** - Current cleanup is rule-based; PRD requests local LLM integration

### Priority Order:
1. US-101 & US-102 (Debug Audio + Fix Format) - Critical for fixing BLANK_AUDIO
2. US-104 (Better Error Handling) - Provide meaningful feedback
3. US-103 (Improve Model Loading) - Better UX for model state
4. US-105 (Audio Debug Mode) - Developer diagnostics
5. US-106 (Local LLM Cleanup) - Enhanced feature

## Tasks

### US-101: Debug Audio Capture

- [x] Add audio level monitoring to AudioManager
  - Scope: Modify `Sources/WispFlow/AudioManager.swift` to compute peak audio level (dB) from captured buffers in the tap callback. Add `@Published var currentAudioLevel: Float` property.
  - Acceptance: `currentAudioLevel` updates in real-time during recording with values in dB scale (e.g., -60 to 0)
  - Verification: `swift build` passes; log audio levels during recording and verify they change with sound input
  - **DONE:** Added `@Published var currentAudioLevel: Float` property, `calculatePeakLevel()` method, and `amplitudeToDecibels()` conversion. Level updates in real-time via tap callback.

- [x] Add audio level meter to RecordingIndicatorWindow
  - Scope: Modify `Sources/WispFlow/RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift` to display a visual level meter (colored bar or SF Symbol) next to the recording icon. Connect to AudioManager's audio level property.
  - Acceptance: Level meter shows real-time audio activity when speaking into microphone
  - Verification: `swift build` passes; start recording and observe level meter responds to voice
  - **DONE:** Created `AudioLevelMeterView` class with color-coded levels (gray<-40dB, green, yellow, red). Added `connectAudioManager()` method using Combine to subscribe to level updates.

- [x] Add silence detection and warning
  - Scope: Modify `Sources/WispFlow/AudioManager.swift` to track if audio has been below threshold (e.g., peak < -40dB) for entire recording. Add callback `onSilenceDetected: (() -> Void)?`.
  - Acceptance: Callback fires if recording stops with only silence detected
  - Verification: `swift build` passes; record without speaking, verify silence warning appears
  - **DONE:** Added `onSilenceDetected` callback, tracks `peakLevelDuringRecording`, alerts user with actionable message if peak < -40dB threshold.

  - Verification: `swift build` passes; record and transcribe, check console for diagnostics
  - **DONE:** Added `logAudioDiagnostics()` method that logs comprehensive diagnostics table including byte count, sample count, sample rate, duration, peak amplitude, peak/RMS levels, sample range, clipping percentage, and format.

- [x] Handle WhisperKit "[BLANK_AUDIO]" response
  - Scope: Modify `Sources/WispFlow/WhisperManager.swift` `transcribe()` to detect "[BLANK_AUDIO]" in results and convert to meaningful error with possible causes (silent audio, format issue, model problem).
  - Acceptance: "[BLANK_AUDIO]" is never shown to user; replaced with actionable error message
  - Verification: `swift build` passes; if BLANK_AUDIO occurs, verify helpful error shown
  - **DONE:** Added `isBlankAudioResponse()` to detect BLANK_AUDIO variants and `createBlankAudioErrorMessage()` to generate context-aware error messages based on audio analysis (peak level, RMS). Returns empty string instead of BLANK_AUDIO.

## Notes

### Discoveries

1. **Current AudioManager** already converts to 16kHz mono Float32 format via AVAudioConverter. However, the converter may silently fail or produce empty buffers - need validation.

2. **WhisperManager.transcribe()** already handles empty results but returns empty string rather than meaningful error. The "[BLANK_AUDIO]" issue likely occurs in WhisperKit itself when audio format is incorrect.

3. **Current implementation** does not preserve audio data after transcription attempt, making retry impossible. Need to cache audio until transcription succeeds.

4. **Rule-based TextCleanupManager** is already comprehensive with 3 cleanup modes. LLM integration (US-106) should be additive, not replacement.

### Risks

1. **Local LLM memory usage** - Running both WhisperKit and LLM may strain memory on 8GB Macs. Consider model size limits and sequential (not parallel) inference.

2. **Audio format edge cases** - Some microphones may produce non-standard formats that AVAudioConverter doesn't handle well. Debug mode will help identify these.

3. **WhisperKit dependency** - WhisperKit requires macOS 14.0+ which limits user base. Cannot downgrade.

### Framework Evaluation for US-106

**llama.cpp Swift**
- Pros: Mature, well-tested, cross-platform
- Cons: C++ core, bridging complexity

**MLX Swift**
- Pros: Apple-native, optimized for Apple Silicon
- Cons: Apple Silicon only, newer/less tested

Recommendation: Start with llama.cpp for broader compatibility, evaluate MLX if performance issues arise on Apple Silicon.
