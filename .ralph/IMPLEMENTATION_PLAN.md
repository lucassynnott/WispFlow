# Implementation Plan - WispFlow v0.4

## Summary

WispFlow v0.3 (US-201 through US-205) is complete with accessibility permission detection, audio buffer pipeline verification, audio capture diagnostics, permission flow UX, and silence detection fixes.

**v0.4 focuses on investigating and fixing two critical issues:**
1. **Audio buffer disconnect** - Level meter shows activity, but transcription reports silence
2. **Model download failures** - Whisper and LLM models fail to download silently

### Key Findings from Code Analysis:

1. **Audio Buffer Architecture Already Unified**: The current `AudioManager.swift` implementation already uses a single buffer path. The level meter calculates from the raw input buffer in the tap callback, and the transcription buffer stores the converted (16kHz) version of the same data. This is correct architecture.

2. **Potential Root Cause - Different Data Sources**: The level meter reads the **raw input buffer** (native device sample rate), while transcription uses the **converted buffer** (16kHz). If the audio converter is failing silently or producing zeros, this would explain the disconnect.

3. **WhisperKit Download Progress**: WhisperKit initializes and downloads models internally, but the current code doesn't effectively capture download progress. The `WhisperKitConfig` doesn't expose a progress callback.

4. **LLM Download Already Has Progress**: `LLMManager.swift` has proper download progress tracking via `URLSessionDownloadDelegate`.

5. **Audio Export Already Implemented**: `AudioExporter.swift` and `DebugManager` already support WAV export functionality.

### Priority Order (based on user impact):
1. US-301 (Audio Buffer Architecture) - Verify and fix the converter path
2. US-302 (Audio Tap Verification) - Confirm tap callbacks are firing with data
3. US-303 (Buffer Integrity Logging) - Trace where data may be lost
4. US-304 (Whisper Model Downloads) - Fix download progress and error handling
5. US-305 (LLM Model Downloads) - Enhance error handling (mostly working)
6. US-306 (Audio Debug Export) - Already implemented, verify functionality

## Notes

### Discoveries

1. **Audio Buffer Architecture is Correct**: The code already implements a unified buffer approach. The level meter and transcription buffer use the same tap callback. The disconnect may be in the **audio converter** (converting native sample rate to 16kHz) rather than separate buffers.

2. **Converter Silent Failure Theory**: The audio converter in the tap callback may be:
   - Producing zeros when conversion fails
   - Not being called (inputBlock not triggered correctly)
   - Returning empty frames on some devices

3. **WhisperKit Progress Limitation**: WhisperKit doesn't expose download progress through its API. The current implementation simulates progress with status messages. A better solution would be to manually download the model files with progress tracking, then point WhisperKit to the local files.

4. **LLM Download Working**: The LLM download code in `LLMManager.swift` has proper progress tracking and error handling. The issue may be specific to certain models or network conditions.

5. **Audio Export Ready**: The `AudioExporter.swift` implementation is complete and functional. It converts Float32 samples to 16-bit PCM WAV format correctly.

### Risks

1. **Converter Device Compatibility**: The audio converter may behave differently on different Mac hardware (M1/M2 vs Intel, built-in mic vs external mic). Need to test on multiple configurations.

2. **WhisperKit API Changes**: WhisperKit may change its model download behavior in future versions. Current workarounds may need updating.

3. **Network-dependent Downloads**: Model downloads depend on Hugging Face availability. Consider adding fallback URLs or local model bundling for reliability.

4. **Sample Rate Mismatch**: If the input device sample rate changes mid-recording (e.g., switching devices), the converter may produce incorrect output.

### Technical Notes

- Audio tap callback runs on audio thread - minimize work and use DispatchQueue.main for UI updates
- WhisperKit expects 16kHz mono Float32 audio with samples in [-1.0, 1.0] range
- AVAudioConverter requires matching formats between input and output nodes
- LLM models are ~1-2GB - downloads may take several minutes on slow connections
- WAV export uses 16-bit PCM format (standard compatibility)
