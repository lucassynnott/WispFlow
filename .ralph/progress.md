# Progress Log
Started: Tue Jan 13 15:58:25 GMT 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- SPM project structure with `Package.swift` for macOS 13.0+ targets
- Menu bar apps use `NSStatusItem` with `LSUIElement=true` in Info.plist
- Recording states modeled with enum + SF Symbol icon names
- Launch at login via `SMAppService.mainApp` (macOS 13+)

## [2026-01-13 16:12] - US-001: Menu Bar App Foundation
Thread: codex exec session
Run: 20260113-160943-91467 (iteration 1)
Run log: /Users/lucasnolan/WispFlow/.ralph/runs/run-20260113-160943-91467-iter-1.log
Run summary: /Users/lucasnolan/WispFlow/.ralph/runs/run-20260113-160943-91467-iter-1.md
- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- No-commit run: false
- Commit: f9289a0 feat(US-001): implement menu bar app foundation
- Post-commit status: clean
- Verification:
  - Command: `swift build` -> PASS
  - Command: `./scripts/build-app.sh` -> PASS
  - Command: `grep LSUIElement .build/WispFlow.app/Contents/Info.plist` -> PASS (LSUIElement=true confirmed)
- Files changed:
  - .gitignore (new)
  - .agents/tasks/prd.md (new)
  - .ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (new)
  - Package.swift (new)
  - Resources/Info.plist (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/main.swift (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/AppDelegate.swift (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/StatusBarController.swift (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/RecordingState.swift (new)
  - scripts/build-app.sh (new)
  - AGENTS.md (new)
- What was implemented:
  - Complete menu bar app foundation with NSStatusItem
  - Microphone icon with idle ("mic") and recording ("mic.fill") states
  - Left-click toggle for recording state
  - Right-click context menu with Settings, Launch at Login, Quit
  - SMAppService integration for launch at login
  - App bundle build script
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Code was already implemented from previous iteration; this run verified and documented it
  - Use `.gitignore` to exclude `.build/` directory from version control
  - macOS menu bar apps need both `LSUIElement=true` AND `setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` in code
  - SMAppService requires `import ServiceManagement` and handles macOS 13+ gracefully

## [2026-01-13 16:25] - US-002: Global Hotkey Recording
Thread: codex exec session
Run: 20260113-160943-91467 (iteration 2)
Run log: /Users/lucasnolan/WispFlow/.ralph/runs/run-20260113-160943-91467-iter-2.log
Run summary: /Users/lucasnolan/WispFlow/.ralph/runs/run-20260113-160943-91467-iter-2.md
- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- No-commit run: false
- Commit: bfb6ae0 feat(US-002): implement global hotkey recording
- Post-commit status: clean
- Verification:
  - Command: `swift build` -> PASS (build complete, no errors)
- Files changed:
  - Sources/WispFlow/HotkeyManager.swift (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift (new)
  - Sources/WispFlow/AppDelegate.swift (modified)
  - .agents/tasks/prd.md (updated acceptance criteria)
  - .ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (updated task status)
- What was implemented:
  - HotkeyManager.swift: Global hotkey listener using NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents and addLocalMonitorForEvents
  - Default hotkey: Cmd+Shift+Space (⌘⇧Space) with configurable HotkeyConfiguration struct
  - RecordingIndicatorWindow.swift: Floating NSPanel pill-shaped indicator
  - Uses NSVisualEffectView for blur background, positioned at top center of screen
  - Pulsing red mic.fill icon animation during recording
  - Cancel button (xmark.circle.fill) that stops recording
  - Show/hide animations with fade effect
  - AppDelegate wires hotkey to toggle recording and indicator visibility
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NSEvent global monitors require accessibility permissions for full functionality
  - NSPanel with .nonactivatingPanel prevents stealing focus from other apps
  - Use both global and local monitors to capture hotkeys when app is active or in background
  - Carbon.HIToolbox provides key code constants (kVK_Space, etc.)
  - NSVisualEffectView with .hudWindow material gives native macOS blur appearance
